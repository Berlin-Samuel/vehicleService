# Title : Vehicle Service


# Description
The overall project is designed using the MVC pattern (MVC i.e. Model, View, and Controller). In the Backend, it is using Spring Boot, at the data access layer the project is using Hibernate Framework, and at the front end, we are using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The Database used here is Oracle Database.

# General Information
Inspection - vehicle components are visually inspected for wear or any leaks. A diagnostic is performed to identify any electrical components reporting a failure or a part operating outside of normal conditions.
Replacement - Given certain lubricants break down over time due to heat and wear, manufacturers recommend replacement. Any parts that are close to their expected failure are replaced too to avoid a failure while operating the vehicle.
Adjustments - as vehicle components wear, they may need adjustment over time.
The completed services are usually recorded in a service book upon completion of each service.
